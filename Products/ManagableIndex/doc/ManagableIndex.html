    <h1>ManagableIndex</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><code>ManagableIndex</code> can mean different things for different
people. For a content manager, it brings flexible field, keyword
and efficient range indexes managable via the ZMI to</p>
<ul>
<li>combine values from different sources, ignoring irrelevant values
  and transforming values in an inadequate form,<br>
  Example: index an object via title if it is non-empty but use
  id otherwise<br>
  Example: add <code>portal_type</code> to the <code>Subject</code> index
  transforming it into a sequence (as required by a keyword index).
<li>control acquisition<br>
  and prevent acquired values to be indexed
<li>ignore stop-terms, normalize terms and check types<br>
  Example: when you do not want that an object is indexed under
    a meaningless default value, you can define this value
    as a stop-term.<br>
  Example: when you want case insensitive searches, you
    can perform case folding during normalization.<br>
  Example: the BTrees underlying Zope indexes require its
    keys to have a persistently consistent ordering.
    When this is not the case, they become corrupt.
    While modern Python versions (at least Python 2.3)
    compare values from different elementary types
    persistently consistent, the result can be quite
    unintuitive. Therefore, it is best when all terms
    in an index belong to the same types. Normalizing
    and type checking helps to ensure this.
</ul>

<p>For a developer, <code>ManagableIndex</code> provides
a framework for index definition, improving on <code>PluginIndexes</code>.
It provides for managability,
automatically and intelligently handles unindexing when an object
is reindexed and implements <em>and</em>, <em>or</em> and
<em>range</em> queries (for not too complex indexes).</p>

<h2>Concepts</h2>
<p>The main tasks of an index are to index objects under
a set of index terms derived from the object and efficiently locate
all objects indexed under a given term.</p>

<p>Indexing consists of 3 stages: evaluation of the object
to obtain the object's value (with respect to the index),
deriving index terms from the value and storing the association
term/object in a way such that
the objects associated with a term can quickly be retrieved.</p>


<h3>ValueProvider</h3>
<p>Evaluation is specified by a sequence of <em>ValueProvider</em>s
associated with the index. 
A ValueProvider is a device that returns a value for an object.
If the return value is not <code>None</code>,
then it is interpreted as the
object's value with respect to this ValueProvider.</p>

<p>A <code>ValueProvider</code> can have an associated
<em>IgnorePredicate</em>, a TALES expression.
When the <code>IgnorePredicate</code> yields true for
a value, then it is ignored. You may e.g. specify that
empty strings should be ignored.</p>

<p>A <code>ValueProvider</code> can have an associated
<em>Normalizer</em>, a TALES expression.
The <code>Normalizer</code> is applied to not ignored values
to transform them in a standard form, e.g. the normalizer
for a keyword index can transform a string into a one element
tuple containing the string as a keyword index requires a sequence
value.</p>


<p>The most essential ValueProviders are <em>AttributeLookup</em>s.
An AttributeLookup determines the object's value through
the lookup of an attribute. The AttributeLookup's configuration
determines whether acquisition can be used, whether a callable value
should be called and whether exceptions should be ignored.
</p>

<p><em>ExpressionEvaluator</em>s are another type of ValueProviders.
These are TALES expressions defining an objects value.
<code>ExpressionEvaluator</code>s often avoid to define
simple scripts just for indexing purposes.<br>
<span class="warning">Warning: </span>Until Zope 2.7, TALES
expressions have been trusted when used outside of Zope; from
Zope 2.8 on, TALES expression evaluation is always subject
to Zope's security restrictions even when used outside of Zope.
This may have strange consequences when you perform index management
(e.g. mass reindexing) in an external script (run outside of Zope).
In such cases, you should probably let the script login as a Zope user
with sufficient priviledges.
</p>

<h3>Value Combination</h3>
<p>When an index has several ValueProviders, their values
must be combined to define the object's value.</p>

<p><code>None</code> and ignored values are always ignored
and are not combined.</p>

<p>Currently, there are three combiners:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>useFirst</code><dd>use the first non-ignored value<br>
  This is available for all kinds of indexes.</dd>
<dt><code>union</code><dd>combine all non-ignored values in a union like way.<br>
  This is only available for indexes that split the object's value
  into a set of index terms (such as keyword or text indexes).</dd>
<dt><code>aggregate</code><dd>combine all values into a list.<br>
  This is only available for index types that expect aggregate values
  such as e.g. a <code>RangeIndex</code>.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Term Standardization</h3>
<p>Once the object's value (with respect to the index) has been
determined, the value is split into a set of index terms
in an index specific way (e.g. a <code>FieldIndex</code>
uses the value directly, a <code>KeyWordIndex</code>
requires the value to be a sequence and uses its elements as
index terms and a <code>TextIndex</code> splits the value into
words and uses the words).
The terms are then standardized.</p>

<p>Standardization consists of serveral steps:
prenormalization such as case normalization, stemming,
phonetic normalization, ...
elimination of
stop terms, normalization such as type conversion,
type checking and copying.</p>


<h4>Prenormalization</h4>
<p>A index can define a term prenormalizer, a TALES expression.
The prenormalizer is applied to terms before term expansion
in queries and always as the first step of normalization during
indexing. It can be used e.g. for case normalization, stemming,
phonetic normalization, synonym normalization, ...</p>

<h4>Stop Terms</h4>
<p>An index can define a <em>StopTermPredicate</em>, a TALES
expression. When the predicate yields true for a term, the term
is ignored.</p>

<h4>Term Normalization</h4>
<p>An index can define a <em>NormalizeTerm</em> TALES expression.
The expression can be used to transform the term into some standard
form, e.g.
convert a descriptive string or complex object into a code
used for efficient indexing.</p>

<h3>Type Restriction</h3>
<p>The BTrees used in index implementation require that any index term must be
persistently comparable to any other index term in this index
(otherwise, the index gets corrupted). To help observing this
essential property, the index term's type can be restricted.</p>

<p>The following type restrictions are defined:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>not checked</code><dd>the type is not restricted at all,</dd>
<dt><code>numeric</code><dd>the type must be a numeric type (<code>int</code>,
<code>float</code> or <code>long</code>),</dd>
<dt><code>string</code><dd>the type must be a string,</dd>
<dt><code>ustring</code><dd>the type must be a unicode string; <code>TermTypeExtra</code> can specify an encoding used for conversion.</dd>
<dt><code>integer</code><dd>the type must be an integer,</dd>
<dt><code>DateTime</code><dd>the type must be a <code>DateTime</code> object or float --
the index stores the date as a float (seconds since epoch),</dd>
<dt><code>DateTimeInteger</code><dd>the type must be a <code>DateTime</code> object or integer -- the index stores the date as an integer (seconds since epoch; truncated, if necessary),</dd>
<dt><code>DateInteger</code><dd>the type must be a <code>DateTime</code> object or integer -- the index stores an integer representing the date
(<code>400 * <var>year</var> + 31 * (<var>month</var>-1) + (<var>day</var>-1)</code>,</dd>
<dt><code>tuple</code> with <var>tuplespec</var> in <code>TermTypeExtra</code><dd>The value must be a tuple
  of the structure given by <var>tuplespec</var>. Each
  tuple component is specified by a letter or by a parenthesized
  <var>tuplespec</var> (for "subtuples"). Recognized
  letters are <code>n</code> (numeric), <code>s</code> (string),
  <code>u</code> (unicode string),
  <code>d</code> (datetime).
  An encoding for unicode conversion can be specified after <var>tuplespec</var>,
  separated by <code>;</code>.
  </dd>
<dt><code>instance</code> with <var>fullClassName</var> in <code>TermTypeExtra</code><dd>the type must be an instance of the given class and the class must define an <code>__cmp__</code> method.
It is assumed without check, that this <code>__cmp__</code>
implements a persistent comparison.
</dd>
<dt><code>expression checked</code> with <code>TermTypeExtra</code> specifying checking TALES expression<dd>the expression may try to transform the
value into something acceptable. If it yields <code>None</code> or
raises an exception, the type is considered inacceptable, otherwise
the value is used instead of the original term.
 </dd>
</dl>

<p>All checkers try to convert a term into an acceptable type.
Only when this fails, an exception is raised.</p>

<p>If you choose one of the integer types, i.e. <code>integer</code>,
<code>DateTimeInteger</code> or <code>DateInteger</code>,
an especially efficient index type is build.
You must clear and reindex the index when the index type is changed.
You must clear the index even when it is already empty (because the data
structures may need to be changed).</p>


<h4>Copying</h4>
<p>It is dangerous to index mutable types. If a indexed mutable object
is later changed, its ordering with respect to other indexed
objects may change, corrupting the index. Corruption of this
kind can be avoided when the mutable object is copied before it
is stored in the index.</p>

<p><code>TermCopy</code>
  specifies whether the value should be directly used,
  shallow copied or deep copied.</p>


<h2>Index Types</h2>
<p>Currently, <code>ManagableIndexes</code> supports 3 types of
indexes: <code>FieldIndex</code>, <code>KeywordIndex</code> and
<code>RangeIndex</code>. Further types can easily be implemented.</p>

<h3><code>FieldIndex</code></h3>
<p>A <code>FieldIndex</code> indexes an object under a single term,
the object's value with respect to the index.</p>

<p>You get efficient DateTime and Date indexes by selecting
<code>DateTime</code> (stored as float),
<code>DateTimeInteger</code> (stored as integer) or
<code>DateInteger</code> (stored as integer) as
<code>TermType</code>. You must clear and reindex when you
change the type.</p>

<p>You can very efficiently sort search results via a <code>FieldIndex</code>.
The <code>ZCatalog</code>'s method <code>searchResults</code>
(aka <code>__call__</code>) supports this via its <code>sort_on</code>
argument. My
<a href="http://www.dieter.handshake.de/pyprojects/zope/AdvancedQuery.html"
> AdvancedQuery</a> product supports arbitrary levels of sorting
via <code>FieldIndex</code>es.</p>

<p><code>AdvancedQuery</code>'s <code>FieldIndex</code> based ascending sorting
is much more efficient than descending sorting. To make descending sorting
more efficient, you can tell your <code>FieldIndex</code> to
maintain the sort keys (also) in reverse order. This will slow indexing down
a bit but make descending sorts much faster. When you change this
attribute, you must clear and reindex the index (otherwise, the
reverse order is not consistent).</p>

<h3><code>KeywordIndex</code></h3>
<p>A <code>KeywordIndex</code> expects the value of an object to
be a sequence. It indexes the object under each element of this sequence.</p>

<h3><code>RangeIndex</code></h3>
<p>A <code>RangeIndex</code> expects an object's value
to be a pair specifying an interval <var>low</var> to <var>high</var>.
The index can efficiently locate documents for which a given term
<var>t</var> lies within the document's <var>low</var> and <var>high</var>
bounds.</p>

<p>The object's value can either by constructed by a single
attribute or with an <code>aggregate</code> combiner.</p>

<p>To provide for a partial plugin replacement for CMF's
<code>effective</code> and <code>expires</code> indexes,
<code>RangeIndex</code> supports a <code>Boundary names</code>
property. If set, it should be a pair of two names
<var>low</var> and <var>high</var>. The index will then
execute queries of the form <code><var>low</var> <= <var>val</var> <= <var>high</var></code>.
To be compatible with <a href="AdvancedQuery"><code>AdvancedQuery</code></a>,
the index replacing <code>effective</code> and <code>expires</code>
should have the name <code>ValidityRange</code>.</p>

<p><code>RangeIndex</code> efficiently supports improper ranges,
i.e. those where at least one boundary is unlimited. You
use its <code>Mininal value</code> and <code>Maximal value</code>
properties to define which values should be considered as
unlimited. These properties are TALES valued and are evaluated
when the index is cleared. All values at or below (the value of)
<code>Minimal value</code> are identified and interpreted
as no lower limit; similarly, all values at or above (the value of)
<code>Maximal value</code> are identified and interpreted as no
upper limit.</p>

<p>The boolean property <code>Organisation 'high-then-low'</code>
controls the index organisation. With <code>high-then-low</code>
organisation, the <code>high</code> index is primary and
the <code>low</code> index is subordinate; <code>low-then-high</code>
indicates the opposite organisation. You should use <code>high-then-low</code>
when <code><var>val</var> <= <var>high</var></code>
is less likely than <code><var>low</var> <= <var>val</var></code>.
This is to be expected for date ranges and typical queries against them.</p>

<h3><code>WordIndex</code></h3>
<p>A <code>WordIndex</code> indexes an object under a set of words.
It uses a <code>ZCTextIndex.PLexicon</code> for splitting a
text into a sequence of words.</p>

<p>A <code>WordIndex</code> lies between a <code>KeywordIndex</code> and a <code>TextIndex</code>.
Like a <code>TextIndex</code>, it uses a <code>Lexicon</code> to split values into
a sequence of words, stores integer word ids in its index
and does not support range queries.
Like a <code>KeywordIndex</code>, it indexes an object under a set of words --
no near or phrase queries and no relevancy ranking.
Due to these restrictions, a <code>WordIndex</code> is very efficient with respect
to transaction and load size.</p>

<p>The motivation to implement a
<code>WordIndex</code> came from my observation, that almost all our ZEO loads
above 100ms were caused by loading large word frequency
IOBuckets used by <code>TextIndex</code>es for relevancy ranking -- a feature
we do not need and use. Many of these loads transfered buckets
of several 10 kB and a considerable portion of them took more
than a second. As word frequency information is necessary for
each document in a hit, you can imagine how fast our queries
were.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a <code>WordIndex</code> is only useful when you
use a flexible query framework, such as e.g. <code>AdvancedQuery</code>
or <code>CatalogQuery</code>.
The standard <code>ZCatalog</code> framework is too weak as it does not
allow to have several subqueries against the same index
in a query. That's the reason why <code>TextIndex</code>es come with
their own query parser. I live in Germany and therefore
the standard query parser is useless for us (we use <code>und</code>, <code>oder</code>,
<code>nicht</code> instead of <code>and</code>, <code>or</code> and <code>not</code>) and I have <code>AdvancedQuery</code> --
thus I did not care to give the new <code>WordIndex</code> a query parser.
You could easily provide one -- should you feel a need for it.</p>

<h3><code>PathIndex</code></h3>
<p>A <code>PathIndex</code> indexes an object under a path. A path is
is either a tuple or a '/' separated string. The index supports
path queries. For a given path, it locates objects that contain
this path as subpath in its path value. Two search parameters
<var>level</var> and <var>depth</var> control where in the
object's path the given path may occur.</p>

<p><var>level</var> and <var>depth</var> can be either <code>None</code>
or an integer. When <var>level</var> and <var>depth</var> are
both greater or equal 0, then an object with path <var>op</var>
matches path <var>p</var> with respect to <var>level</var>
and <var>depth</var>, iff <code><var>op</var> = <var>p1</var> <var>p</var> <var>p2</var></code> and
<code>len(<var>p1</var>) = <var>level</var></code> and
<code>len(<var>p2</var>) = <var>depth</var></code>.
This means that <var>level</var> controls <var>p</var>'s distance
from the beginning
and <var>depth</var> that from the end of <var>op</var>.
A <code>None</code> value means
that there is no restriction for the respective side.
A negative value means that the distance from the respective side
may be up to (including) the negated value. E.g. a "-2" allows
up to 2 segments.</p>

<p>The default value for <var>level</var> is <code>0</code>,
that for <var>depth</var> is <code>None</code>.</p>

<p>Note, that <code>getPhysicalPath</code> requires acquisition
to work properly. You must not set the acquisition type for
such a value provider to <code>none</code>.</p>


<h2>Matching</h2>
<p>Most string and unicode based indexes (exception <code>RangeIndex</code>)
support regular expression and glob matching. You use
the query option <code>match</code> with a value of <code>'glob'</code>
or <code>'regexp'</code> to call for this feature.</p>

<p>Note that for large indexes, the match term should begin with
an (easily recognizable) plain text string. Otherwise, this
query type can be very inefficient.</p>



<h2>TALES Expressions</h2>
<p><code>ManagableIndex</code> uses TALES expressions at many places.
They always can use the predefined variables:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>index</code><dd>the index</dd>
<dt><code>catalog</code><dd>the catalog</dd>
<dt><code>root</code><dd>the zope root object</dd>
<dt><code>modules</code><dd>the modules importer</dd>
<dt><code>nothing</code><dd><code>None</code></dd>
<dt><code>value</code><dd>the value to be checked</dd>
<dt><code>object</code><dd>the object currently indexed</dd>
</dl>

<p>If the TALES expression evaluates to a callable object, then
this is called on the value and the result used; otherwise, the
evaluation result is used directly.</p>

<h2>Utilities</h2>
<p>The module <code>Utils</code> contains some useful functions:
<code>convertToDateTime(value)</code>,
<code>convertToDateTimeInteger(value, exc=0)</code>
and 
<code>convertToDateInteger(value, round_dir=-1)</code>.
Please see the source documentation, for details.</p>

<h2>Programmatic Creation</h2>
<p>A primary goal for <code>ManagableIndex</code> is the easy and flexible
configuration via the Zope Management Interface (ZMI). Occasionally, however,
you want to create your ManagableIndexes programmatically and want to
configure them in the same step. The <code>ZCatalog</code>'s
<code>[manage_]addIndex</code> allow you to pass configuration information
down to the index construction in the <code>extra</code> argument.</p>

<p>For the creation of a ManagableIndex, <code>extra</code> must have
a dict value.
Its key <code>'ValueProviders'</code> determines the indexes'
value providers. All other keys can provide values for the indexes
properties.</p>

<p>If the key <code>'ValueProviders'</code> is present, its value
must be a sequence of value provider specifications which define
the value providers for the index. If the key is not present, a
default value provider is created.</p>

<p>A value provider specification is a dict with the mandatory keys
<code>'id'</code> and <code>'type'</code>. <code>type</code>
specifies the value provider's type (<code>'AttributeLookup'</code> or
<code>'ExpressionEvaluator'</code>). Additional keys can defined values
for the value providers properties.</p>

<p>If the configuration dicts contain keys different from the above mentioned
special ones and not corresponding to a property,
a <code>ValueError</code> exception is raised.</p>

<p>Look for the <code>_properties</code> definitions in the source, to
determine the available properties for the various types of objects.</p>
